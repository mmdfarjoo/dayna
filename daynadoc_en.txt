In this program written with tkinter, I tried to design it like a toolbox, this program is still in beta version and I am developing it and trying to make the tools in the software more and more useful. .
I'm new to Python programming and I'm working on it. If you see a problem in the codes, please fix it :)
I apologize if my code is messy :)


Well, the program works like this:

In the input field, enter pre-made commands to open your comment window.
The commands I have written in beta version 0.01 are as follows:
    Time or Date = Show time and date

    Speed ​​test = speed test internet display

    Search or email = search in google and send mail in google gmail

    Roll = show a random number

    contact me = set your username (don't mess it up :)))

    cal or calculator = show the calculator

    Open = Open the program in your operation



    I uploaded the source code of this program freely on GitHub and if you like it, I would be grateful if you could run this program.

    Thankful :)
